# Monitor a data warehouse in Microsoft Fabric

In Microsoft Fabric, a data warehouse provides a relational database for large-scale analytics. Data warehouses in Microsoft Fabric include dynamic management views that you can use to monitor activity and queries.

This lab will take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

> **Note**: You need a [Microsoft Fabric trial](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/get-started/fabric-trial) to complete this exercise.

## Create a workspace

Before working with data in Fabric, create a workspace with the Fabric trial enabled.

1. On the [Microsoft Fabric home page](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com), select **Synapse Data Warehouse**.
1. In the menu bar on the left, select **Workspaces** (the icon looks similar to &#128455;).
1. Create a new workspace with a name of your choice, selecting a licensing mode that includes Fabric capacity (*Trial*, *Premium*, or *Fabric*).
1. When your new workspace opens, it should be empty.

## Create a sample data warehouse

Now that you have a workspace, it's time to create a data warehouse.

1. At the bottom left, ensure that the **Data Warehouse** experience is selected.
1. On the **Home** page, select **Sample warehouse** and create a new data warehouse named **sample-dw**.

    After a minute or so, a new warehouse will be created and populated with sample data for a taxi ride analysis scenario.

## Explore dynamic management views

Microsoft Fabric data warehouses include dynamic management views (DMVs), which you can use to identify current activity in the data warehouse instance.

1. In the **sample-dw** data warehouse page, in the **New SQL query** drop-down list, select **New SQL query**.
1. In the new blank query pane, enter the following Transact-SQL code to query the **sys.dm_exec_connections** DMV:

    ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_connections;
    ```

1. Use the **&#9655; Run** button to run the SQL script and view the results, which include details of all connections to the data warehouse.
1. Modify the SQL code to query the **sys.dm_exec_sessions** DMV, like this:

    ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_sessions;
    ```

1. Run the modified query and view the results, which show details of all authenticated sessions.
1. Modify the SQL code to query the **sys.dm_exec_requests** DMV, like this:

    ```sql
   SELECT * FROM sys.dm_exec_requests;
    ```

1. Run the modified query and view the results, which show details of all requests being executed in the data warehouse.
1. Modify the SQL code to join the DMVs and return information about currently running requests in the same database, like this:

    ```sql
   SELECT connections.connection_id,
    sessions.session_id, sessions.login_name, sessions.login_time,
    requests.command, requests.start_time, requests.total_elapsed_time
   FROM sys.dm_exec_connections AS connections
   INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_sessions AS sessions
       ON connections.session_id=sessions.session_id
   INNER JOIN sys.dm_exec_requests AS requests
       ON requests.session_id = sessions.session_id
   WHERE requests.status = 'running'
       AND requests.database_id = DB_ID()
   ORDER BY requests.total_elapsed_time DESC;
    ```

1. Run the modified query and view the results, which show details of all running queries in the database (including this one).
1. In the **New SQL query** drop-down list, select **New SQL query** to add a second query tab. Then in the new empty query tab, run the following code:

    ```sql
   WHILE 1 = 1
       SELECT * FROM Trip;
    ```

1. Leave the query running, and return to the tab containing the code to query the DMVs and re-run it. This time, the results should include the second query that is running in the other tab. Note the elapsed time for that query.
1. Wait a few seconds and re-run the code to query the DMVs again. The elapsed time for the query in the other tab should have increased.
1. Return to the second query tab where the query is still running and select **X Cancel** to cancel it.
1. Back on the tab with the code to query the DMVs, re-run the query to confirm that the second query is no longer running.
1. Close all query tabs.

> **Further Information**: See [Monitor connections, sessions, and requests using DMVs](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-warehouse/monitor-using-dmv) in the Microsoft Fabric documentation for more information about using DMVs.

## Explore query insights

Microsoft Fabric data warehouses provide *query insights* - a special set of views that provide details about the queries being run in your data warehouse.

1. In the **sample-dw** data warehouse page, in the **New SQL query** drop-down list, select **New SQL query**.
1. In the new blank query pane, enter the following Transact-SQL code to query the **exec_requests_history** view:

    ```sql
   SELECT * FROM queryinsights.exec_requests_history;
    ```

1. Use the **&#9655; Run** button to run the SQL script and view the results, which include details of previously executed queries.
1. Modify the SQL code to query the **frequently_run_queries** view, like this:

    ```sql
   SELECT * FROM queryinsights.frequently_run_queries;
    ```

1. Run the modified query and view the results, which show details of frequently run queries.
1. Modify the SQL code to query the **long_running_queries** view, like this:

    ```sql
   SELECT * FROM queryinsights.long_running_queries;
    ```

1. Run the modified query and view the results, which show details of all queries and their durations.

> **Further Information**: See [Query insights in Fabric data warehousing](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-warehouse/query-insights) in the Microsoft Fabric documentation for more information about using query insights.


## Clean up resources

In this exercise, you have used dynamic management views and query insights to monitor activity in a Microsoft Fabric data warehouse.

If you've finished exploring your data warehouse, you can delete the workspace you created for this exercise.

1. In the bar on the left, select the icon for your workspace to view all of the items it contains.
2. In the **...** menu on the toolbar, select **Workspace settings**.
3. In the **General** section, select **Remove this workspace**.
